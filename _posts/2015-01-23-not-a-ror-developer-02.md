Keeping on my journey to give life to my pet project, yesterday I spent the whole morning trying to add a logic where I can add items in a model via AJAX and then refresh the dropdown list of this model.

And in the afternoon I spent some hours fixing some bugs I did because Rails 4 turbo links, just newbie stuff.

Today I realize that what I did was in the wrong page. And today I'm planing to move to other page all the logic that I did, let's see how long it takes.
