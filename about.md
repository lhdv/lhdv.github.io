Hello, I'm [LH](mailto:lh@lhdv.net), I'm from [SÃ£o Paulo][1]{:target="_blank"}, [Brazil][2]{:target="_blank"} and here I'll write about my personal thoughts on technologies, human behavior and software development. 

Sometimes I'll probably use this blog as my *"everywhere notebook"* to take a note of some tip or something else important.

I make a living as a consultant of [Oracle][3]{:target="_blank"} Technologies. And also I am very courious about new programming languages and some server stuff.

I **do** like mountain bike downhill/freeride, many years ago I used to compete in some local races but nothing very serious it was just to put more adrenaline on the ride.
