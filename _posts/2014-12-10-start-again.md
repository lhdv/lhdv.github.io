In this year I've been developing my skills in Ruby and Rails and the best thing that helps you to get close to the new programming languages that you're learning is solve a problema that you have.

So I choose one of the thousand problems that I have e decided to solve it building a simple webapp using Ruby and Rails. But I was learning all the ecosystem and everything else of the language/framework so I developed in a "step-by-step" pace to fell more confortable and to have plenty of time for learning what I have to learn.

Because I had a trip planned and I had a lot of things to plan and organize I put this little webapp *on hold* to cotinue it after my trip.

And now it's time to remember all the things I've done, the why's, where's and what's(and a lot of WTF!?). For me during the process of learning a new language/framework I am not a guy who comment a lot in my experimentation code and now I'm in a deep process of reading everything else that I've code dig deep in the directories created by Rails and basically learn everything again.
