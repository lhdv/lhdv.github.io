I make my living as a programmer, but working with proprietary tools and software(Oracle Stack basically).

And in my spare time I'm working on a software to myself and as I've studied ruby and rails some months ago, I choose them to build it.

Basically I'm trying to build a simple webapp to keep track of what I buy at the market, the quantity and price to help me remember what I need to buy and how much I spent in the past months. And it should work both in desktop and mobile browsers.

This week I begin my journey making a basic scaffold e trying to fight against a very rudimentary frontend.

I've studied some javascript after ruby/rails, but I'm facing that it was enough. For my needs, I really need to improve my skills in javascript and jquery.
